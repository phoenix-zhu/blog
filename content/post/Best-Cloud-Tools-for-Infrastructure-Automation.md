瞎逛看到这个非常全面的自动化工具集，按照字母顺序排列，原文请见[**Best Cloud Tools for Infrastructure Automation**](http://stackifyblog.sys-con.com/node/4079796)


There are two main reasons for infrastructure automation. First, system administrators, IT professionals and DevOps engineers need to automate as many routine tasks as possible. That's why we build tools at Stackify to help developers automate processes like [application performance management](https://stackify.com/application-performance-management-solution/), [error monitoring](https://stackify.com/error-monitoring/), and [log management](https://stackify.com/log-management/); automation means you have more time for mission-critical tasks. Second, automation makes the management of complex, diverse environments possible and allows rapid scaling.

Whether you are using a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud, infrastructure automation tools will come in handy. The following is a look at the 50 best cloud infrastructure automation tools available today, which we've listed below in alphabetical order.
